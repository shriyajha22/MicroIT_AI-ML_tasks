TASK 1 : PASSWORD GENERATOR

The Password Generator is a simple Python project designed to create strong, secure, and random passwords based on user-defined criteria. It allows users to specify the desired password length and choose whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The generator ensures that the passwords are both unpredictable and robust, making it a useful tool for enhancing online security and preventing unauthorized access. Ideal for personal use or as a beginner-friendly Python project to practice logic and user interaction.


TASK 2 : SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

Sentiment analysis is a machine learning project that involves analyzing text data to determine the emotional tone or sentiment behind it, classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral. This process uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to interpret text and predict the sentiment of customers, users, or individuals towards a product, service, or brand.


TASK 3 : TIC-TAC-TOE GAME

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a square with their symbol (X or O) in an attempt to get three of their symbols in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends when one player wins or if all squares are filled without a winner, resulting in a draw. It’s a simple yet strategic game that can be played on paper or as a digital application.
